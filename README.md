This is not finished! - currently working on it!

This is a FTP protocol that adheres to the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) spec for sending files into space. This project is being built for a student lead space initiative at the Univerity of Alberta called ABsat. 

I want to eventually make it opensource, but there is a lot of work to do before it is in any condition for use.
